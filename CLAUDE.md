This is a website similar to abg.ninja which will have a variety of tests available to practice.

The code will be written in JavaScript, React and Tailwind and run using node.js, bundled using vite for static deployment. Development is done using the vite dev server.

The sitemap looks like this:

- /: contains links and brief descriptions to each of the tests
- /dexamethasone: dexamethasone suppression test

The style should be minimal, with a beige background colour, and modern theme. The typeface should be Fira Sans.
